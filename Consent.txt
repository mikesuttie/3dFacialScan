CIFASD – Validating 3D imaging techniques for FASD clinical integration
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you give your consent to volunteer, it is important that you read the following information and ask as many questions as necessary to be sure you understand what you will be asked to do.

Purpose of the Study
The purposes of this study are 1) to better identify adults affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, and 2) to validate low-cost 3D facial imaging techniques using mobile devices. Funding for the study is provided by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).
Description of the Study
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to have three images of your face taken using:
• a high-end (gold standard) 3D camera (Canfield Scientific www.canfieldsci.com)
• an iPhone 3D image capture method using input from TrueDepth cameras
• a series of standard 2D images taken from a mobile device
The 3D images captured will be used as a control group to analyse and detect prenatal alcohol exposure-associated facial features in an adult population. The iPhone 3D image will be utilized to assess low-cost imaging methods against the gold standard camera system.
Risks or Discomforts
We will ask a few brief questions regarding your ancestral origin, date of birth, biological sex, and potential for prenatal alcohol and smoke exposure, you do not need to answer these questions if you do not feel comfortable doing so, please tick the ‘unknown’ or ‘rather not say’ boxes if this is the case or leave blank. Image capture is non-invasive and does not hurt, if at any time you feel uncomfortable, you may stop participation temporarily or completely. Image acquisition from all three methods should take no longer than 5-10 minutes.
Benefits of the Study
The benefits of this study include the contribution of information to the scientific community. Although direct benefits from this study are minimal, participation in this study may offer enrollment in future studies that include more personalised feedback (i.e., a report summarizing the results of your participation). You may also wish to have your 3D image, which we can give to you at the time of scan on a USB device.
Confidentiality
All information will be kept strictly confidential to the extent allowed by law. Your name, image, or any identifying information will not be revealed in any connection with this study, in public or in print. The information collected as a part of this project is part of a larger group of cooperating research projects, called the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD), that study prenatal exposure to alcohol and other childhood behavioral concerns or conditions. Because the project is being done with other researchers, data collected by our site will be sent electronically to a central location and will be used by other researchers in the group. Names will not be included in these shared data. Instead, we may assign a code number, called a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) to your research information. This number is generated by entering some information you provide into a secure database. Other researchers may also request access to these data but again, no names will be released. Deidentified data from this study will also be submitted to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Data Archive (NIAAADA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIAAADA is a large database where de-identified study data from many NIAAA studies is stored and managed. Deidentified study data means that all personal information about you (such as name, address, birthdate and phone number) is removed and replaced with a code number (GUID). Facial images are classified as identifiable, and, as such will not be uploaded to the NIAAADA. Other researchers may also request access to these data but again, no names or images will be released. Sharing your study data does have some risks, although these risks are rare. Your study data could be accidentally shared with an unauthorized person who may attempt to learn your identity. The study researchers will make every attempt to protect your identity. You may not benefit directly from allowing your study data to be shared with NIAAADA. You may decide now or later that you do not want your study data to be added to the NIAAADA. You can still participate in this research study even if you decide that you do not want your data to be added to the NIAAADA. If you decide that you do not want your data to be added to the NIAAADA, call or email the study staff who conducted this study, and they will tell NIAAADA to stop sharing your study data. Once your data is part of the NIAAADA, the study researchers cannot take back the study data that was shared before they were notified that you changed your mind. If you would like more information about NIAAADA, this is available on-line at https://nda.nih.gov/niaaa.
Voluntary Nature of Participation
Participation in this study is voluntary. If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your consent and to stop your participation at any time.
You may choose to have your information removed from the study at any time, or choose not to share your image with CIFASD collaborators. To do so, please contact the principal investigator, Dr Michael Suttie (michael.suttie@wrh.ox.ac.uk).
Please check the box below if you do not want the information you provide to be used by other CIFASD investigators.
 I would like the images and information I provided to remain at the University of Oxford and not shared with other CIFASD investigators
